## Networking

### OSI Layer Model
- **Application Layer** - Providing networking options to programs running on a computer.
- **Presentation Layer** - Translates data into standardised format, as well as handling encryption, compression, or other transformations to data.
- **Session Layer** - Making and logging a session to a connection.
- **Transport Layer** - Choose protocol from TCP or UDP. Divides the transmision data into byte sized pieces. `TCP - Segments` `UDP - Datagrams`
- **Networking Layer** - Decides the best route to take by looking at the IP (Logical addressing). (Still controllable by softwares).
- **Data-Link Layer** - Stamping the receiving MAC address (endpoint's) by looking at IP. Also checks corruptions and formatting. `NB : Actually physical address is used to transmit data across networks. Which can spoofed and act as a client`
- **Physical Layer** - Electric pulses make up data transfer over a network `Binary data -> Signals (Transmitting)` `(Receiving) Signals -> Binary data`

### NIC (Network Interface Card)
NIC is used to connect to a digital network. Basically this means it allows your computer to speak in bits like it would talk to any other part of itself.

- **Authentication** - Credential thing.
- **Authorization** - is someone has the rights to access something.
